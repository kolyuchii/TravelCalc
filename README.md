# TravelCalc

It helps calculate the time for sleep or rest during long distance cycling and move with your custom average speed.
Example: your minimal average speed is 15 km/h and your current average speed was 20 km/h over 10 hours then you will have 3.3 hours to rest. After that you should ride again to your average speed was at least 15 km/h
